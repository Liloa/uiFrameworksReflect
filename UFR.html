    So writing(coding) anything in a new language can be hard and frustrating at first
    but the only reason for this is because you do not know what possibilities are out
    there.
    &nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
      What I am trying to get at is that damn you get all of the tools out there and you
    can see that they are some of the best out there that you can get your hands on but
    for some reason you just can't do what the next guy can do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just because I like to give examples of whenever I try and understand things I am gonna
    start you off with an example if you just don't know what I am trying to say(half the
    time I don't even know what im saying). So hear me out. Just imagine if you had the exact
    same materials and pigments as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Leonardo+da+Vinci&oq=Leonardo+da+Vinci&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1l5j0i131k1j0i67k1j0j0i67k1l2.33863.33863.0.34265.1.1.0.0.0.0.120.120.0j1.1.0....0...1.2.64.psy-ab..0.1.119....0.VGtbZjVXr64">Leonardo da Vinci </a>, you know the guy who painted Mona Lisa. Now imagine
    if you had Mona herself in the exact same position and setting as the painting. What is
    stopping you from doing the exact same work as da Vinci? Yep you just don't know the
    techniques, the style, oh and probably the experience. But if you just took a class
    that helped you walk through the steps to maybe painting a beach landscape, maybe they
     could teach you some easy techniques and maybe help you be a better painter. They would
     probably show you how to hold a brush or what type of brush is best or show you this
     creative way to add texture to your painting. Then viola! you have a flat surface of
     pigments mixed with a binding agent(s) and something that sort of looks like a beach.
    But hey you cant be too harsh on yourself, it's your first painting. (This would probably
    be what a regular html experience would be like).
  </p>

    Now just imagine if you had the new "Paintbrush 9 mk.9000"(patent pending). And this brush
    had all of these buttons. Some buttons would include the simple stuff; select color, select
    thickness, paint ocean color, paint the tallest <a href="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2012/12/largesttree.jpg">red wood tree </a> in
    the world on a 9x9 canvas, oh and create a new color never seen by man. Now this is what using
    ui frameworks can help you achieve in the world of coding (html at least... not sure of its real
    limits). Too bad this brush is a regular pen until you install modules into it via the old technology
    known as cat5. This doesn't sound so bad till you realize that installation can take a long time
    like a really long time like as long as it would take to count 604,800 seconds. That's just the
    mk. 1 modules. but after some time of installation and understanding how it works its in your pen
    for almost forever... unless you break it of course. Using ui frameworks can make you seem
    way better than the guy next to you who hasn't heard of it before. But like da Vinci you have
    to practice and basically be brilliant. After you learn how to do the small tricks then the world
    opens up to you and it is just so worth it to invest your time in and learn how to make life easy
    and not have to struggle to learn raw html and css. I know my world opened up to me and I feel like
    I can accomplish way more than I ever could have. I can make a proto website for those that
    will someday contract me to work for them and build things for money. It is a big door that
    is opened. But the door has a weird shape and to actually get through you have to contortion
    yourself in and flex joint to fit. In the end worth it of course. In the world of today where
    we have just been born, there has been so much learned and discovered before us. Now we have to
    play catch up to get to their level so we can make our own progress. I feel that this method
    of programming and utilizing the tool of frameworks can help us shorten that time of
    catch up and put is in the right direction of progress. Forward.
